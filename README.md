📏 My First Project – Unit Converter

This is my first Python project — a simple Unit Converter that converts length units like meters, centimeters, and kilometers.
I built this project to learn Python basics and understand how simple logic can solve real-world problems.

🚀 What It Does

Converts between centimeters, meters, and kilometers

Takes user input for value and unit

Shows the converted result instantly

🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

Use Python input/output

Work with conditional statements (if-elif)

Handle basic arithmetic operations

Write clean and simple code

🖥️ How to Run
python unit_converter.py

💡 Note

It might be a small project, but it’s a meaningful first step in my journey as a future computer engineer! ⚙️
